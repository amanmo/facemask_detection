# Facemask Detection

This repository contains 1 Python file and 2 HAAR Cascade Classifiers stored as XML files.

The Python file opens up your webcam feed and detects masked and unmasked faces.
The classifier for faces is from the widely available OpenCV for Python project.
Whereas, the mask classifier was trained by me using UCI's Maching Learning Repository.
